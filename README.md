# PNK Software

The PNK software sets up a local wireless networking system with a range of integrated tools, including a server, chat service, and document editor. Once configured, the system operates independently, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration within a self-contained network. (placeholder text)

**This software package was developed with a strong commitment to community collaboration and shared progress. We encourage you to use and contribute to it in a spirit of collective improvement and mutual benefit, ensuring that it serves the greater good and fosters positive innovation.**
